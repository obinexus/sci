We are a little bit confined with the unknown zero, half a number, and let's call it 0.1.

0.1 acts as a proto-bit or isomorphic seed. It is not a whole bit of information, but the beginning of structure. It marks the shift from absence to encoded presence-between the unknown zero and a structured number system.

Let's try this way:

0.1 is a transition.

It also represents a loss in value-a scalar quantity. If we imagine an x-axis, 0.1 describes a deviation, a lack, or a perturbation from stability.

We can introduce a state mapping system using two scalar quantities:

+1: represents a fully present or affirmed value in a state space

-1: represents the mirrored, absent, or inverted state in an opposing or orthogonal universe

Together, these define an asymmetric state relationship. 0.1 then lives between these poles, as a transitional or emergent value that breaks symmetry and marks the beginning of computation or encoded differentiation.

This scalar behavior makes 0.1 a hinge point, capable of referencing both informational presence and energetic lack-useful for modeling systems in transition, entropy drops, or unstable initial conditions.
