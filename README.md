Sci: OBINexus Science

Overview

Sci is a foundational research initiative by OBINexus focused on rethinking particle dynamics, survival logic, and cosmological evolution through modular encoding systems. The goal is to bridge rigorous mathematical theory with testable computational models.

Sci stands for Science, but more precisely: Structured Conceptual Intelligence.
